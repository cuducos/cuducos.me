Hi, I am Cuducos!

I'm a geek interested in technology, culture and politics.

As a [<abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> in sociology](https://cuducos.me/phd) I enjoy reflecting upon power dynamics of our daily digital life, my passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking and I might have inherited a _hands on_ mood from my <acronym title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</acronym> in Graphic Design.

I have worked at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org), [Open Knowledge Brasil](https://ok.org.br), and [Jusbrasil](https://jusbrasil.com.br). Also, I am one of the co-founders of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai) and founder of [Minha Receita](https://github.com/cuducos/minha-receita).

I love pet projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br) and [yaml.nvim](https://github.com/cuducos/yaml.nvim), as well as tiny bots as [AirNope](https://github.com/cuducos/airnope), [No More Stories](https://github.com/cuducos/no-more-stories) and [wed](https://github.com/cuducos/wed).

I'm engaged in open source — founding and collaborating to [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/) and some people [support me with a drink here and there](https://github.com/sponsors/cuducos).

I'm a Brazilian non-binary who prefers they/them pronoums, and I am based in <span itemprop="workLocation">Ottawa, ON, Canada</span>.
