I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and in politics. As a PhD in sociology ([University of Essex, UK)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life, but my passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking — and I might have inherited a _hands on_ mood from my BA in Graphic Design ([UFSC, Brazil](https://ufsc.br)).

Currently, I'm a the backend tech lead at [Rings AI](https://www.ringsxrm.com/). I have worked at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org), [Open Knowledge Brasil](https://ok.org.br), [Datopian](https://datopian.com) and [Jusbrasil](https://jusbrasil.com.br). Also, I am one of the co-founders of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai).

I love side projects such as [Minha Receita](https://github.com/cuducos/minha-receita), [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), and [AirNope](https://github.com/cuducos/airnope). I'm engaged in open source — founding and collaborating to [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/) and some people [support me with a drinks here and there](https://github.com/sponsors/cuducos).

I'm based in <span itemprop="workLocation">Ottawa, ON</span>. Feel free to join me for a cup or a pint if you believe in the _power to the people_ motto : )
