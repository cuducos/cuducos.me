I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and in politics. As a PhD in sociology ([University of Essex, UK)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life, but my passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking — and I might have inherited a _hands on_ mood from my BA in Graphic Design ([UFSC, Brazil](https://ufsc.br)).

I have worked at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org), [Open Knowledge Brasil](https://ok.org.br), and [Jusbrasil](https://jusbrasil.com.br). Also, I am one of the co-founders of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai) and founder of [Minha Receita](https://github.com/cuducos/minha-receita).

I love triathlon, side projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br) and [yaml.nvim](https://github.com/cuducos/yaml.nvim), and tiny bots as [AirNope](https://github.com/cuducos/airnope), [No More Stories](https://github.com/cuducos/no-more-stories) and [wed](https://github.com/cuducos/wed). I'm engaged in open source — founding and collaborating to [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/) and some people [support me with a drink here and there](https://github.com/sponsors/cuducos).

I'm a Brazilian non-binary using _they/them_ pronoums, and I am based in <span itemprop="workLocation">Ottawa, ON</span>.
