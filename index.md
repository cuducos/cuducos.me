I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and in politics. I have inherited a _hands on_ mood from the BA in Graphic Design I hold. My passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking. And as a [PhD student in sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3456) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life.

I'm a co-founder of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai) currently working as a developer for [Jusbrasil](https://www.jusbrasil.com.br), connecting people to justice using open data. I love side projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145) and [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites). I'm also engaged in open source — founding and collaborating to [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/).

I'm based in <span itemprop="workLocation">São Paulo, Brazil</span>. Feel free to join me for a cup or a pint if you believe in the _power to the people_ motto : )
