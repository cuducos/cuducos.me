I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and in politics. As a PhD in sociology ([University of Essex, UK)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life, but my passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking — and I might have inherited a _hands on_ mood from my BA in Graphic Design ([UFSC, Brazil](https://ufsc.br)).

I'm a citizen engagement fellow at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) and one of the co-founders of [Operação Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai). In addition I love side projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145) and [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites). I'm also engaged in open source — founding and collaborating to [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/).

I'm based in <span itemprop="workLocation">Washington, DC</span>. Feel free to join me for a cup or a pint if you believe in the _power to the people_ motto : )
