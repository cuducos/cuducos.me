Autonomy is what I treasure the most. A world with more autonomous individuals is a better world for all of us. In this pursue for empowerment I had technology, sociology and design as my super powers while hacking cultures and lifestyles.

In sum I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and in politics. I have inherited a _hands on_ mood from the BA in Graphic Design I hold. My passion for technology introduced me to the idea of hacking. And as a [PhD student in sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3456) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life.

I’m involved in many side projects such as [Operação Serenata de Amor](http://serenatadeamor.org), [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145) and, [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites). I'm also engaged in open source — founding, and collaborating to, [various projects](https://github.com/cuducos/).

If is there any truth to be known it is within ourselves. I am always looking for mindfulness. I can find some peace of mind when I'm surrounded by people, in meditation, going out for a run, or even while bread baking. I can also find it in a glass of a good scotch whisky or in a Bob Dylan album.

I'm based in <span itemprop="workLocation">Brazil</span> and in the <span property="workLocation">UK</span>. Feel free to join me if you believe in the _power to the people_ motto : )
